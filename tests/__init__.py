import locale

# Set the locale to C to ensure consistent output across different systems
# (e.g. for error messages).
# This is necessary because the locale is inherited from the environment
# and can cause tests to fail if the output is different (e.g. due to
# different decimal separators).
# 'C' is a locale that is always available and should be understood by all
# systems.  'C' is for the POSIX locale, which is the same as the 'en_US'
# locale on some systems.
locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'C')
